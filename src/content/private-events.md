Do you like the idea of a paint party but want to do an event that is a bit more controlled or personal? Night of Acrylics can bring the paint party to you with a private event!

You can handle the venue (event space, hall, someone's house, etc), food, drinks, music, and we'll bring all of the painting equipment, an artist, and our years of Art & Entertainment experience.

Need music or something else? Let us know in the form below and we can work with you.

### Pricing

Private events are $30 per person for the first 40 people. After 40 people, each additional person is $25. To book a private event, we require a minium of 20 people ($600).
